In this python project, I analyzed the following dataset: 
Transactions(Sports_leisure).csv 

You can find this dataset in the data folder of this portfolio (data-analytics-portfolio). 

Analysis:
I perfomred an analysis based on this dataset which can be found in the ipython notebook or jupyter notebook. The name of the notebook is "Transactions(Sports_leisure).ipynb"

I have uploaded this notebook to the python_project. 

In this, I have conducted some basic analysis of the transactions related to the Sports_leisure product category. There are also some clustering and statistical analysis based on this dataset.

21/02/2025:

I have two notebooks demonstrating cost analytics models for product pricing decisions using synthetic data. 
These notebooks serve as a proof of concept for applying cost analytics to optimize pricing strategies. 
They illustrate how simple predictive and prescriptive models can inform business decisions and can be extended or refined with real-world data.

The notebooks are as follows: 
1. cost_analytics (logistic regression).ipynb
2. cost_analytics(classification).ipynb

**Logistic Regression Notebook** 
In this notebook, a predictive model using linear regression recommends an optimal product price based on three key factors:
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Competitor Price
Historical Sales Volume

This analysis provides insights into how underlying costs and competitor pricing influence the optimal pricing strategy.

**Classification Notebook**
This notebook details a decision tree classifier for pricing action. 
The model recommends a pricing action—whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the price—based on market conditions and sales performance.

Defined Rule:
1. Increase: If the competitor price is more than 2 units higher than the current price.
2. Decrease: If the competitor price is more than 2 units lower than the current price and the sales volume is below the median.
3. Maintain: Otherwise.

This model aids in making informed pricing decisions by categorizing products based on market competitiveness and sales performance.
