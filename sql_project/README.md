Database Setup
The database, named ecommerce, was created using the datasets. Each dataset was converted into a corresponding table, forming a relational database.

Tables Created
The following tables were created in the ecommerce database:
1. orders: Information about customer orders.
2. order_items: Details of items included in each order.
3. order_payments: Information on payment methods and transactions.
4. customer: Data about the customers.
5. product_category_name: Mapping of product categories and their descriptions.
6. seller: Information about the sellers in the marketplace.
7. products: Details of the products available for purchase.

Repository Content
This repository includes:
1. SQL queries used for creating each table, uploaded as separate .sql files.
2. A structured approach to creating and populating the ecommerce database.
